Project: Vision Perception and Locomotion Control of Biped Robots for Complex Terrain 
* Simulation-to-Reality Validation: Achieved motion control transfer from Isaac Gym simulation to physical LIMX bipedal robot through parameter optimization, enabling stable walking. 
* Terrain System Development: Designed a terrain generation module to enhance adaptability in complex terrains. 
* Gait Algorithm Optimization: Improved motion stability by refining gait generation via adversarial imitation learning.
