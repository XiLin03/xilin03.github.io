Project: The Modeling and Experiments of Obstacle Traversal of Legged Robots 
* LSTM motion modeling: Build a time series prediction model with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.87 (p<0.01) 
* Data generation system: Design a random training data generation pipeline based on GMM and expand the size by300%. 
* Motion constraint modeling: Establish a non-complete constraint equation to verify the nonlinear relationship between angular velocity and posture error
