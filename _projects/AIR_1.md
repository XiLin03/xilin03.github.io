With [Prof. Xingyu Liu](https://xingyul.github.io/) 
* Terrain System: Developed a procedural terrain generation module to enable curriculum learning for robots
* Hierarchical Control Framework: Integrated 3D visual-semantic understanding with multimodal perception (SLAM) to dynamically switch terrain-adaptive locomotion policies.
* VLA-SLAM Integration: Implemented language-guided navigation and semantic obstacle avoidance by VLA with SLAM.
