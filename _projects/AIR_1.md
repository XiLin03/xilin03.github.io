With [Prof. Wenchao Ding](https://wenchaoding.github.io/personal/index.html) 
* Simulation-to-Reality Validation: Achieved motion control transfer from Isaac Gym simulation to physical LIMX bipedal robot through parameter optimization, enabling stable walking. 
* Terrain System Development: Designed a terrain generation module to enhance adaptability in complex terrains. 
* Gait Algorithm Optimization: Improved motion stability by refining gait generation via adversarial imitation learning.
