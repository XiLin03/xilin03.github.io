I am a Master student in Robotics, Johns Hopkins Univresity, working on Athletic Intelligence, Control, and Robotics. I am currently working as a research intern at Wuxi Research Institute of Applied Technologies, Tsinghua University. Before that, I was a member of Terradynamics Lab at Johns Hopkins University. Before the enrollment at Johns Hopkins University, I am a undergraduate student at Dalian University of Technology.

I am intetested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Control in Robotics. My research focuses on the locomotion of varieties of robots on different environment.

I am looking for research and intern opportunity now.
