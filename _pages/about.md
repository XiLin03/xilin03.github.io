I am a Master student in Robotics, Johns Hopkins Univesity, working on Athletic Intelligence, Control, and Robotics. I am currently working as a research intern at Wuxi Research Institute of Applied Technologies, Tsinghua University. Before that, I was a member of Terradynamics Lab at Johns Hopkins University. Before the enrollment at Johns Hopkins University, I am a undergraduate student at Dalian University of Technology.

I am intetested in the intersection of Machine Learning, and Control. My research focuses on the locomotion of varieties of robots on different environment.

I am looking for research and intern opportunity right now.
